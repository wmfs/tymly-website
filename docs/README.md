- title: Open Standards
  details: "Tymly fundamentally separates the objectives of a digital service from the suppliers and technology which would traditionally deliver them. If that's not disruptive enough, these objectives are defined using open standards: opening-up a whole new world of collaborative working and interoperability."
- title: Open Source
  details: Once all your digital-service objectives are written using a standard vocabulary, Tymly offers an Open Source platform to deliver them effortlessly throughout your organisation... and beyond! Built by a UK Fire Service, Tymly is designed to deploy digital capability into the most demanding of environments.
- title: Open Ethos
  details: As per government best practice, Tymly is built in-the-open on GitHub. Anyone is free to use and contribute to Tymly, helping make it capable of even bigger-and-better things. We've already had contributions from central government departments and even internet-giant Amazon!
