- title: Fresh thinking
  details: "Tymly is a software platform for delivering modern digital services. Our innovative 'digital building bricks' approach brings many efficiencies compared with procuring different systems or undertaking single-use software development."
- title: Freedom
  details: In Tymly, the constituent parts of a digital service (its forms, data structures, workflows etc.) are all described using open standards. This means organisations can create, adapt and share digital service definitions independently of any supplier.
- title: Open Source
  details: "We build Tymly in the open. This means anyone is free to use and contribute to the code powering the Tymly platform - helping improve its functionality for everyone. We've already had code contributions from central government and even Amazon!"
