features:
- title: Fresh thinking
  details: "Tymly is a software platform that takes a fresh approach to digital service delivery. Our configurable 'digital building blocks' bring many organisational efficiencies - compared with procuring systems or undertaking bespoke software development."
- title: Open Source
  details: "We build Tymly in the open. This means anyone is free to use and contribute to the code powering Tymly - helping make it capable of bigger and better things for the benefit of everyone. We've already had contributions from central government and even Amazon!"
- title: Open Standards
  details: Using Open Standards is a fundamental part of Tymly's design. We use standards to define form layout, data structure and workflow. This focus on openess helps breakdown barriers normally associated with collaboration and interoperability.
